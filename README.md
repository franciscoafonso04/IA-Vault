# IA-Vault

Welcome to the IA-Vault, a repository containing our projects for the Artificial Intelligence (Inteligência Artificial) course. Here, you'll find implementations exploring intelligent algorithms, probabilistic methods, and optimization techniques to solve complex problems efficiently.

## Projects

### Project 1: Wedding Seating Plan
**Description:** Developed an AI-based solution for optimizing wedding seating arrangements using probabilistic methods and simulated annealing. The project focused on creating an optimal guest arrangement that maximizes seating preferences while minimizing conflicts. Key features include:
- **Probabilistic modeling** to evaluate seating configurations.
- **Simulated annealing** for optimization.
- **Graphical interface using Pygame** for real-time visualization.
- **CSV-based input system** for flexible guest list management.
