# 🤖 Artificial Intelligence Projects – FEUP 2024/25

This repository contains two applied Artificial Intelligence projects developed during the 2024/25 academic year at **FEUP** (Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto) for the course **IART – Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning Techniques**.

Each project tackles a different real-world problem using distinct AI methodologies:  
one focuses on **optimization with metaheuristics**, and the other on **machine learning classification**.
